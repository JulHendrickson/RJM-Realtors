### Project Description:
---

     Our objective is to apply *Supervised Learning Machine Model* to *predict housing prices*.
     In order to use this model, we will need a dataset with a range of variables such as number of bedrooms, square footage, location, condition of the property, past housing prices etc.
    Once we prepare the dataset, we will apply the SVM algorithim to the data to create a model that predicts housing prices based on the input features (X).
We will *test* the model for *accuracy*.

### Project Outline
---

- [ ] Import necessary libraries

- [ ] Read in the data

- [ ] Separate the Features (X from the Target (y)

- [ ] Split the data into training and testing sets

- [ ] Create a Support Vector Model

- [ ] Fit (train) the model using the trainig data

- [ ] Score the model using the test data

- [ ] Make Predictions

- [ ] Generate the Confusion Matrix

- [ ] Generate the Classification Report

- [ ] Create visualization to showcase findings
