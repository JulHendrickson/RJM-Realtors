### Project Description:
---

Exploratory Analysis and Building a Linear Regression model using Housing data to predict or analyze housing prices based on various features like square footage, the number of bedrooms, location, and more.  

In order to use this model, we will need a dataset with a range of variables such as number of bedrooms, square footage, location, condition of the property, past housing prices etc.
     
Once we prepare the dataset, we will apply the Linear Regression algorithim to the data to create a model that predicts housing prices based on the input features (X).
